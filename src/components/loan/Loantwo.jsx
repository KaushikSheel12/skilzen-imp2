          Indian students are becoming more and more inclined to complete their
          studies overseas. While the US, UK, and Canada continue to be some of
          the top options, Australia and EU nations are not far behind in terms
          of educational prospects. Getting an education loan for abroad studies
          is one of the most preferred options to finance education during the
          time of the course. For students who aspire to study abroad, many
          banks and other lenders now provide overseas education loans.
          Different student loan programmes are available from these lenders,
          but picking the one that is best for you might be challenging. We at
          UniCreds bridge the gap & help you tackle this challenge of choosing
          the best education loan. Our experts guide you to pick the most
          suitable competitive education loan available toda

          Different types of Education Loans to study abroad
        </p>

        <p className="md:mt-7  mt-5 md:text-[17px]">
          There are two types of education loans for abroad studies on the basis
          of Collateral. Both types are explained in detail below:
        </p>

        <p className="mt-10  text-[17px]">
          <span className="font-semibold"> Secured Education Loan:</span> A
          secured education loan, often known as a loan with collateral,
          requires the applicant to provide either material or immaterial
          security. A pledge of security to the lender may take the form of real
          estate, a fixed deposit, a life insurance policy, etc. Since the bank
          needs to confirm all the paperwork pertaining to the pledged security,
          this type of loan acceptance takes longer. However, it has lower
          interest rates on student loans, lengthier payback schedules, and no
          repayment throughout the course of school. Additionally, there is a
          larger likelihood that this education loan will be authorised, and
          parental income is not a factor in a loan acceptance.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-10  text-[17px]">
          <span className="font-semibold"> Unsecured Education Loan:</span> In
          the case of an unsecured education loan for abroad studies, the
          applicant is not required to put up any security. This is an education
          loan for abroad studies without collateral. This form of education
          loan is suitable for students who do not have any security to give.
          However, it should be noted that an unsecured education loan is more
          difficult to get approval for and has a higher rate of interest
          (compared to secured loans). Unsecured student loans also have a
          shorter repayment period and certain repayments must be made while the
          borrower is still in school. Additionally, for education loans without
          collateral, a minimum co-applicant income is required.

              Calculate the eligibility for your student loan with this basic
              calculator. It will assist you in calculating the amount for which
              you are eligible. You will have your loan application rejected if
              you apply for an amount greater than you are eligible for. Your
              valuable time and money will be lost, plus you will have no idea
              of the exact sum you should apply for.
